# Frontend Nginx Dev Config

## Setup

__Mac:__ [Install Homebrew:](http://brew.sh/#install)

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

__Nginx:__

    # Mac
    brew install nginx

    # Linux
    sudo apt-get install nginx

Add the following to your ```/etc/hosts```:

    127.0.0.1   profile.thegulocal.com
    127.0.0.1   m.thegulocal.com


## Now run the frontend setup script for nginx [setup.sh](setup.sh):

    sh setup.sh

## Setup Nginx

You will have to make sure the ```sites-enabled``` folder is included in your ```nginx.conf``` (usually in ```/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf```):

    # ...
    http {
        include       mime.types;
        default_type  application/octet-stream;
        # THIS IS WHAT YOU MUST ADD
        include sites-enabled/*;
    #...

## Note

Both [frontend-test.crt](frontend-test.crt) and [frontend-test.key](frontend-test.key) are test values that are not used in production or anywhere else across the Guardian so can be public.
