Equal pay and equal rights would be nice.” </p> <p>Last year <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2014/06/04/cover-story-lana-del-rey-is-anyone-she-wants-to-be\">Del Rey told Fader magazine</a> that feminism was “just not an interesting concept”. She added: “I’m more interested in, you know, SpaceX and Tesla, what’s going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities. Whenever people bring up feminism, I’m like, god. I’m just not really that interested … My idea of a true feminist is a woman who feels free enough to do whatever she wants.” </p> <p>Gordon also criticised Del Rey’s romanticising of dying young, in what may have been a reference the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/12/lana-del-rey-ultraviolence-album\">Ultraviolence star’s 2014 Guardian interview</a>, in which she said “I wish I was dead already … I don’t want to have to keep doing this.” </p> <p>Gordon wrote: “If she really truly believes it’s beautiful when young musicians go out on a hot flame of drugs and depression, why doesn’t she just off herself?”</p> <p>This follows criticism by<a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/55670-frances-bean-cobain-to-lana-del-rey-the-death-of-young-musicians-isnt-something-to-romanticize/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac\"> Frances Bean Cobain, who in 2014 posted on Twitter:</a> “I’ll never know my father because he died young &amp; it becomes a desirable feat because ppl like u think it’s ‘cool’”</p> <p>Girl In A Band will go on sale on 24 February and features Gordon’s thoughts on Kurt Cobain and sexist UK music journalists, along with details on her marriage to former bandmate Thurston Moore. In an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/06/kim-gordon-sonic-youth-women-kickass-book-extract\">exclusive extract published in the Guardian</a>, Gordon revealed details of their crumbling relationship: “I was furious. It wasn’t just the responsibility he was refusing to take; it was the person he had turned me into: his mother. We tried to save it. We were both in therapy and seeing a marriage counsellor, too. But it was like dealing with an addict who was unravelling, who couldn’t stop himself. He and I still slept in the same bed – it was a big bed – but in the mornings, we would get dressed and go downstairs and do our own thing. I could either put up with the humiliation, or I could end things.”</p> <ul> <li>This footnote was added on 26 February 2015. The quote about Lana Del Ray was taken from the pre-release galley of Kim Gordon’s book. The published book contains a different version: “Today we have someone like Lana Del Rey … who believes women can do whatever they want, which, in her world, tilts toward self-destruction, whether it’s sleeping with gross old men or being a transient biker queen.”<br /></li> </ul>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-02-26T15:18:45.258Z","standfirst":"<p>The Sonic Youth founder’s

'","body":"<p>To locate the visiting team’s locker room at Madison Square Garden, New York, you have to be escorted through a series of corridors, lifts and swinging doors. You pass numerous loading trucks outside, whose wares are being dispatched to the dizzying number of crew members and caterers inside.</p> <p>The amount of work required just to put on tonight’s Brit-studded show – Sam Smith is headlining, with George Ezra in support – can seem disorientating on its own. You’d therefore assume it might be at least a little nerve-racking for 21-year old Ezra, sitting in the huge room more frequently occupied by sweaty members of the Orlando Magic basketball team. This, after all, is his first gig in the US. Whereas most new artists learn the ropes at New York’s Mercury Lounge or Arlene’s, he’ll be debuting at a venue that’s currently playing host to Billy Joel, Maroon 5 and <a href=\"http://www.thegarden.com/events/2015/february/wwe-live-road-to-wrestlemania.html\">WWE Live: The Road to Wrestlemania</a> featuring Hulk Hogan.</p> <p>Ezra, however, doesn’t really seem to do nerves.</p> <p>“Nah,” he says breezily. “Half-an-hour set goes quickly … you either gain their interest or you don’t.”</p> <p>Is that it? What about the hall’s iconic status? The 18,200 capacity? The daunting challenge of trying to break a new country?</p> <p>“The fact it’s so mad just makes me relax more,” he says with a cheerful shrug, before explaining his approach to the craziness of life as a pop star: “If it lasts two years? Awesome. If it’s 12 years? Awesome, just enjoy it; it’s not the be-all and end-all.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHrLPs3_1Fs\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHrLPs3_1Fs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>This disarming level-headedness crops up a lot when talking to Ezra. His recent success, he says, is just a “bonus” of being able to play guitar and sing. He takes any fame with a “pinch of salt”. At one point he’ll say “It’s just my job” and compare the fact he has to sing his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHrLPs3_1Fs\">hit Budapest </a>dozens of times a week to the role of a pizza guy churning out margaritas to order.</p> <p>His modesty seems genuine, but also a touch unromantic. After all, he was one of 2014’s commercial success stories: only Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith sold more albums in the UK than his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/29/george-ezra-wanted-on-voyage-review\">debut Wanted On Voyage</a>. The anthemic, bluesy choruses of songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubztYMkI3fY\">Cassy O’</a> helped him pull huge crowds at festivals including Latitude. And at next week’s Brits he’s nominated for four awards: British male solo artist, British breakthrough, British single (for Budapest), and British album. That’s really not like making pizzas. Can’t he allow himself an ego rampage once in a while?</p> <p>“Nah, I think you’d have to be wired wrong to act like that!” he laughs.</p> <p>Ezra is a naturally self-assured, happy-go-lucky guy. He often thinks of the other things he might have excelled at. “Like how I’ve never tried skiing,” he says. “If I’d done it when I was 12, I could be Britain’s best skier! Whenever the Olympics is on, I’m always like: ‘If only someone had put a javelin in my hand ...’”</p> <p>Ezra’s musical (rather than cruelly thwarted athletics) story began in his teens, when he played rhythm guitar and sang with Harlow indie band Anything In Mind (“At that age, you don’t care what the audience thinks, which is the best way to develop,” he says). One day, while experimenting with his singing voice, he realised he could locate a much deeper, more soulful vocal than he previously knew was in him.</p> <p>“At first I kept it to myself,” he says. “I was excited, but there was a part of me that was thinking: ‘Is this cool? Is this a good sound or do I just think that?’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"097bc078290f71b58052bf05fc50b4fcef0b00a6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/19/1424360587828/435cde5b-e315-42f4-aebd-7508c0acfbeb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"George Ezra onstage in Paris, February 2015. Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Ezra onstage in Paris, February 2015.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A student at Bristol’s BIMM music academy at the time, he road-tested it on the city’s open-mic circuit, which proved a colourful training ground: “You’d get overweight divorcees who want to tell you too much about their private life, and then sing a shit cover.”</p> <p>After building a fanbase, Ezra suddenly found himself being courted by all the major labels, and it’s here that his grounded attitude really reaped benefits.</p> <p>“Some of them used the wrong tactics around me,” he says. “I could see right through them. That whole wining and dining thing …”</p> <p>He didn’t like it?</p> <p>“I was 18! And being taken to fancy Asian restaurants where the lights aren’t really on, you can’t see what you’re ordering, and it’s £20 for a spring roll! All I wanted was to catch the last train back to Bristol and get to the pub.”</p> <p>Ezra chose to sign with Columbia, one of the few labels that didn’t seem bothered about forcing its own ideas – remixers, collaborations – upon him. The label did, however, put him in touch with Athlete’s Joel Pott, who helped shape Wanted On Voyage as part of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/29/singers-become-songwriters-hits-one-direction\">growing trend of older indie tunesmiths collaborating with teenage pop prospects</a> (see also Snow Patrol’s Iain Archer and Jake Bugg).</p> <p>Before writing Wanted On Voyage, Ezra craved inspiration that reached beyond his hometown, and so bought a train ticket to hop around Europe for a month. So was he overcome by the romantic pull of life on the road, or did he write a debut album about InterRailing? Ezra, understandably, opts for the former: “I always try and say in interviews that I didn’t go travelling. I went for just under four weeks. That’s not travelling!”</p> <p>However you label it, the experience reaped artistic rewards. His most famous hit, Budapest, was inspired by his travels, although he never actually visited the city; he got drunk in Malmo with a trio of Swedish girls and ended up too hungover to make his train there. What’s most striking about Ezra’s youthful pursuits is how they contrast with his influences: Bob Dylan, Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie being the central three. Like Bugg, the music he most identifies with is from a bygone era, although Ezra says what he loves most about those records is how young and free they sound. He talks enthusiastically about one of the original songs on Dylan’s debut album called Talkin’ New York, which documents the singer’s early experiences on the Greenwich Village folk scene.</p> <p>“He was 19 or 20 when he wrote that. He’s just moved there and it’s his adolescent view on the big city. It’s just the wide-eyed thing, and I see that in myself, even though I’ve had to grow up in the last two years because I’m busy and need to be on top form.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubztYMkI3fY\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubztYMkI3fY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Ezra’s growing-up involves no longer drinking or smoking on show days. He admits to having enjoyed the “perks” of booze and groupies, but accepts it can clash with the reality of having to knuckle down. He’s even invited his sister Jess on tour, so that she can keep him on the rails. “She lets me do whatever I need to until it’s like: ‘Don’t be a dick.’ She’ll point out what I have to do in the morning, and I’m like: ‘Oh yeah, thanks.’”</p> <p>In a rare forlorn moment, he points out that the guys in his band can go out boozing most nights while the pressure remains on his shoulders: “If I don’t perform, then the first thing will be: ‘George fucked up’, you know?” His schedule can be “a bit fucked-up ... if they could have six of me working across the world, they would.”</p> <p>It sounds like he is being turned into a music-industry battery hen. “Nah,” he says, his sunny demeanour taking over. “I don’t get overwhelmed or fussed by it.” Besides, he says, there are worse things than radio sessions.</p> <p>Ezra’s personality might lack the narcissistic instability we often crave in our pop stars, but at least he has the honesty to be himself, and admit there’s no darkness lurking within. Sure, he might mention Lou Reed as a lyrical influence, but you can’t imagine Reed claiming, as Erza does, that there’s nothing he likes more than chilling out with a movie and a bathbomb from Lush. He might have a song – Drawing Board – that involves the vengeful murder of an ex-girlfriend, but it’s so cartoonish you can only really take it as a joke. This, after all, is a guy who used his air miles to fly his mum out to New York to see him play. He’s not really about to stuff his former paramour’s pillowcase with snakes.</p> <p>Ezra ends our interview by talking about his plans: he’d like to release an album of children’s songs, as Woody Guthrie once did (“Songs are good for kids, they kickstart their brains into remembering something they might not have otherwise remembered”); for his next album, he wants to decamp to Barcelona and write there. The details are fuzzy, as befits a man taking each day as it comes. You get the feeling, though, that, however it pans out, Ezra will be pretty happy with his lot.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-02-20T00:05:34.296Z","standfirst":"<p>The blues-folk singer is nominated for four Brits, but being a pop star isn’t the be-all and end-all of his ambitions </p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/46x75","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/19/1424360182763/george-ezra-001.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"455491718","byline":"Tim Jonze","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-22T18:30:00+00:00"},"elements":[{"id":"126f42ff76a6ab8533419966957c5754ec838a48","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/19/1424360194059/george-ezra-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Image by Blackham","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/19/1424360194059/george-ezra-009.jpg","source":"Robert Blackham","photographer":"Robert Blackham","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"george-ezra","height":"1236","credit":"Photograph: Robert Blackham/Robert Blackham","caption":"Harlow Guthrie: singer-songwiter George Ezra.

London’s Hyde Park","headline":"Blur announce The Magic Whip, their first new album for 12 years","body":"<p>Fans of Britpop pioneers Blur had reason to celebrate on 19 February, as the group announced details of their first album in 12 years, entitled The Magic Whip.</p> <p>Describing the follow-up to 2003’s Think Tank as a return to “the way we recorded when we started,” Damon Albarn said that the album was similar in style to the music David Bowie made during his mid 70’s Berlin period. </p> <p>Initially conceived in Hong Kong, during downtime following a cancelled show in Japan, the band spent five days laying down ideas. It wasn’t until Graham Coxon reprised these sessions and presented them to long-time producer Stephen Street, who went on to develop them with the guitarist, that they realised they might have material worthy of a new album.<br /></p> <p>“They did some editing and some production work and sent around the initial tracks and we all realised we’d done something quite special there,” said drummer Dave Rowntree. “There was 18 months [in-between recording the songs] which allowed us to have a bit of perspective on it. When they played it back, that was the time everyone got very excited.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/blurofficial/statuses/568412331077709826\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheMagicWhip?src=hash\">#TheMagicWhip</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/7cgD1hd5y0\">pic.twitter.com/7cgD1hd5y0</a></p>&mdash; blur (@blurofficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blurofficial/status/568412331077709826\">February 19, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The band made their announcement at a hastily arranged press conference in a Chinese restaurant in London, hosted by Zane Lowe, which was also live-streamed <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blur\">on Facebook</a>. Until this point, Albarn admitted that the band had gone as far as they could go without returning to the studio: “I really felt at the end of the last gigs that that was it - there was no way we could do another gig without an another album.” </p> <p>Since the album’s completion last year, the band have kept information about the new record under wraps. “We had a blood pact between us about who we were allowed to tell and who we weren’t so I’ve had to do a lot of catch up phone calling today!” said Rowntree. “A fair few angry people going ‘Why wasn’t I in the circle of trust!”</p> <p>The songs featured on The Magic Whip were influenced by their surroundings in Hong Kong. “There’s nothing pastoral about it - it’s very urban,” said Albarn. “It wasn’t a flash studio, it was pretty claustrophobic and hot. We went in and knocked about loads of ideas.”</p> <p>One track, Ong Ong, was described by bassist Alex James as a “banger”, while another is said to describe Albarn’s thoughts on North Korea. “It’s my impression of the place, in an abstract, veiled way,” he said. </p> <p>In support of the album, Albarn, Coxon, James and Rowntree also announced that they will headline this year’s British Summer Time in Hyde Park on 20 June, the fourth time they have played there. </p> <p>While Think Tank, the band’s seventh album, remains the last under the Blur banner, Coxon was absent for the majority of its recording process: the guitarist only features on one song, its melancholic closer, Battery in Your Leg. The Magic Whip marks their first proper full-length as a quartet since 1999’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/21/favourite-album-blur-13\">13</a>.</p> <p>In the intervening years, the group have reformed for a number of major live shows: they headlined Hyde Park and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/29/blur-glastonbury-2009\">Glastonbury</a> in 2009, not to mention the London Olympics closing concert in 2012. So far, fans have only been privy to two new tracks since their reformation: the one-off single <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/02/blur-under-westway-puritan\">Under the Westway/The Puritan</a>, in 2012. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp1ks7PTzng\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sp1ks7PTzng?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the meantime, Albarn has been busy with numerous projects – albums with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gorillaz\">Gorillaz</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/13/favourite-album-good-bad-queen\">the Good the Bad &amp; the Queen</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/22/rocket-juice-and-the-moon-review\">Rocket Juice &amp; the Moon</a>; two operas, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/29/classicalmusicandopera.manchesterfestival2007\">Monkey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/10/dr-dee-an-english-opera-review\">Dr Dee</a>; his continuing work with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/africa-express\">Africa Express</a>; guest appearances on albums by Massive Attack and Tony Allen, and production for the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/dec/03/best-albums-2012-bobby-womack\">Bobby Womack</a>; not to mention his Mercury-nominated solo album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/24/damon-albarn-everyday-robots-review\">Everyday Robots</a>, in 2014. </p> <p>Coxon, meanwhile, released his eighth solo album, A+E, in 2012, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/26/blur-dave-rowntree-labour-candidate\">Rowntree</a> pursues <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/may/11/blur-drummer-solicitor-legal-aid\">political endeavours</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/aug/24/alex-james-plastic-cheese-punk\">cheese-maker</a> James’s culinary adventures have even extended to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jan/14/blur-alex-james-wants-name-drinks-range-britpop\">fizzy drink</a> franchise. </p> <p>Albarn first hinted that there might be an eighth Blur album in 2013, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/25/damon-albarn-blur-havent-got-time-for-new-album\">following the cancelled</a> Japan shows. “The opportunity came and we took it,” James told Bang Showbiz. “We were just jamming, but it was good.”</p> <p>The frontman’s jam-packed schedule has often been held responsible for impeding the band’s musical progress: in 2012, William Orbit claimed that Albarn pulled the plug on a set of “amazing” recording sessions. “Damon, brilliant and talented tho he is, is kinda a shit to the rest of Blur,” <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/24/blur-album-sessions-william-orbit\">he wrote</a>.<br /></p> <p>Having formed at London’s Goldsmiths College in the late 80s, Blur’s debut album, Leisure, was released in 1991. Famous for pioneering the Britpop movement, the band went on to challenge their northern rivals, Oasis, in 1995 when the bands released singles at the same time: Blur’s Country House outsold the Oasis’s Roll With It by 274,000 to 216,000. “Blur won the battle, Oasis won the war, then Blur went on to win the whole campaign,” bassist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/may/08/inspring2008blurandoasis\">James once said</a>. What with suggestions that <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/oasis/82441\">Oasis might one day re-form</a>, perhaps the fight isn’t quite over just yet. </p> <p>The Magic Whip will be released on 27 April. The full tracklist is as follows: </p> <p>Lonesome Street<br />New World Towers<br />Go Out<br />Ice Cream Man<br />Thought I Was A Spaceman<br />I Broadcast<br />My Terracotta Heart<br />There Are Too Many Of Us <br />Ghost Ship<br />Pyongyang<br />Ong Ong <br />Mirrorball</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-02-20T00:21:41.691Z","standfirst":"<p>The Magic Whip features the

<u>(1)</u>! You’re about to release </strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/vpal-dist/oh-jah-jah-eddie-murphy-panda-bear-productions-vpal-music-2014\" title=\"\"><strong>reggae single Oh Jah Jah</strong></a><strong> and have talked in the past about how you’ve been making music for ages. Have you got a little vault of songs recorded?</strong></p> <p>I wouldn’t say a vault. Prince has a vault of songs – I have a shelf. I have a well-stocked shelf of tracks that I’ve worked on over the past 20 years.</p> <p><strong>You told Rolling Stone that you “could put out an album in any genre”.</strong></p> <p>Oh, yeah. Because I wasn’t trying to fit into some type of radio format or be a rock star, I can go in so many different directions. Just like I can play everybody around the dinner table – I can play the old man, the mother, the grandmother – I can do that as a musician. Because I do impressions, I think I pick up stuff. I can go to a country song, go right into it and make it sound authentic. And I think that’s because of my ear as an impressionist.</p> <p><strong>So the key to being a great musician is to make The Nutty Professor or Big Momma’s House? <u>(2)</u></strong></p> <p>Well, you know what, I think that musicians listen to other music and reinterpret it. They’re using the same muscle.</p> <p><strong>What’s happening with your next album? </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eddiemurphy\" title=\"\"><strong>Your Twitter bio</strong></a><strong> still says it is “coming soon”.</strong></p> <p>Oh, yeah, I remember that. I don’t even know who handles that. I don’t do any of that stuff – I only just got a phone not long ago, I don’t even have a computer.</p> <p><strong>Seriously?</strong></p> <p>I’m not plugged into it at all, I’m almost a technophobe. I don’t know anything about that kind of stuff. I’m sure I have accounts set up and someone does that stuff, but it’s not me. They all say “You gotta have it!” – so I have it, but I’m not involved in it. <strong><u>(3)</u></strong></p> <p><strong>Wouldn’t you want to plug into social media to promote your songs?</strong></p> <p>That’s what everybody was telling me. I do think the music business has changed for the better now. We have iTunes, which is like the big record store now. Before, if I went to a record company with a song like Oh Jah Jah they’d be like: “What is this? How do we – what? Eddie Murphy singing a reggae song?” But now because of the way the business is, we went to VP Records, which just does reggae music only, and we said: “Here’s just a single” – because now the whole business is about singles – “Can you work this?” Now you can go right to the source.</p> <p><strong>You recently told Rolling Stone: “I can’t make a wack track because I know what wack is.” But most people panned your </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMQ3jwqH_lU\" title=\"\"><strong>1993 single with Michael Jackson, Whatzupwitu</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p> <p>You know, I was dancing around in the clouds with Michael Jackson. However wack anyone thought Whatzupwitu was, there’s not a lot of people that have footage of themselves dancing around in the clouds with Michael Jackson. I do have that for ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMQ3jwqH_lU\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMQ3jwqH_lU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>And obviously you’d known Michael, and imitated him in your standup about a decade before collaborating. </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I knew Michael for years and years before that track came out. What’s interesting, when you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ew2UcpDuQ0\" title=\"\">watch that routine from Delirious</a> when I’m doing Michael Jackson jokes, that was actually the first time anybody even did a joke about him. It’s not mean-spirited at all, it’s just all about how he was so sensitive. And then I sang. Michael loved Delirious, it was playful and fun.</p> <p><strong>How’d that compare to Saturday Night Live, where you imitated Stevie Wonder while stood right beside him?</strong></p> <p>Michael and Stevie were people that I knew, and they were part of my social circle. I was able to play around and poke fun – they would never get mad. If you look at it, and compare it to the stuff that people are doing now, it’s totally not mean-spirited. And going back to what I was saying, people are allowed to not like something. And maybe a lot of people did think Whatzupwitu was wack, and that’s what’s cool about music: you have a visceral response to it, and you either like it or you don’t, as soon as you hear it. The good thing about that is that if you come with a hot track, they’re gonna like it. So just because somebody didn’t like a track I put out, that never stopped me. I’ve always written, recorded and produced – I never stopped doing it. I stopped putting music out, but I didn’t stop making it. Then it got to now where if you listen to Whatzupwitu and then you listen to Oh Jah Jah, you can tell that I’ve been in the studio working at this.</p> <p><strong>So Oh Jah Jah’s a hot track, then?</strong></p> <p>Absolutely. A hot reggae track.</p> <p><strong>People reading this might know you as an actor and comedian, but have never heard of your music. What’s the Eddie Murphy music starter pack?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/19/eddie-murphy-snl-sketch-bill-cosby\">Eddie Murphy refused to perform SNL sketch as Bill Cosby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think the first song I ever did was Party All the Time, which Rick James produced. On the very first two records I might have had outside producers, then I decided: “You know, I’m just going to do this myself.” Because I was playing, and there in the studio looking over the producers’ shoulders saying: “How about this?” And then I was doing it at home, but I wasn’t ever doing it to get more famous or to pay the bills. It became like a hobby.</p> <p><strong>All of this was happening in your home studio?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, for years. For 25 years, I’ve had a setup at home. And it’s not just serious music like Oh Jah Jah. It’s all types of stuff, all different types of music: funny stuff, country-western music, it’s jazz. I’m going in any direction I want to go in over the past 25 years. You’re at home, nobody’s watching you, so I’ve been experimenting. Not all of it’s great, but some of it’s interesting.</p> <p><strong>Who was more fun to collaborate with: Rick James or MJ? <u>(4)</u></strong></p> <p>Well, Michael was really private and he didn’t party like Rick. When you’re around Rick, you’re having a party, so I’d have to say him based on that [laughs]. But Michael was the most talented musician and artist that ever lived. So if you go to collaborate and have fun: Rick. If you want to do something really special: Michael [laughs].</p> <p><strong>You must’ve seen the </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0w099fw4lw\" title=\"\"><strong>Chappelle Show skit about Rick James and Prince</strong></a><strong>, with your brother Charlie?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I did. I was never on the set, but I was a fan of the show. And I relived all that stuff that had happened with Prince and Rick James.</p> <p><strong>What would it take to get you back on SNL? Would you return as a host? </strong></p> <p>No. But if I ever went back there I would host and be the musical guest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"683eba3eaf26fa9b00b69e3f1e9350559c5af4e9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/19/1424360630663/bb9e1419-4e51-4450-8434-3d66cd62641e-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Eddie Murphy at the premiere for Norbit in 2007.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Murphy at the premiere for Norbit in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picture Perfect/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>When you started on SNL, as a teen, where did you find the balance between comedy and music?</strong></p> <p>I had a band before I did standup – I’ve always done music. I got known for being funny and that’s how I make a living – and from acting – but I never stopped playing and producing and recording music. And every now and then you see someone like [Rolling Stones guitarist] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/13/art\" title=\"\">Ronnie Wood, and this dude can really paint</a>. There’s a lot of artists that have other stuff that they can do. A lot.</p> <p><strong>You said in the past that the idea of actors getting into music – which </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/21/johnny-depp-labels-actor-musicians-sickening-mortdecai\" title=\"\"><strong>Johnny Depp recently said made him “sick”</strong></a><strong> – kept you from sharing all your music publicly. </strong></p> <p>Yeah, because that’s what this looks like: being one of those actors trying to sing. I’m not an actor trying to sing, this is one of my passions. But if Don Johnson and Bruce Willis just put out albums, and then you put out an album, people don’t want to hear no shit about “it’s your passion” [laughs]. But you might end up listening to it like: “Heyyy, this is isn’t just a bunch of actor-singing, and some of this stuff is actually kinda good …” Music right now is mostly just dance music and love songs and “shake it” and “party all night”. Nobody’s really saying anything like on Oh Jah Jah.</p> <p><strong>How much did you travel to the Caribbean to prep for this track? </strong></p> <p>There’s a bunch of places in the world I haven’t been to, ’cos I can only be on a plane for a little bit. I’m like: “How long is it to get there? Two days on a plane? What? No.” But I’ve been all throughout the Caribbean, that’s only five or six hours – I can do that.</p> <p><strong>Before you go, what’s the deal with Beverly Hills Cop 4?</strong></p> <p>We’ve been trying to get that together for years and years. I’m just not doing any more movies until the scripts are super-solid and perfect and ready and funny and special. I don’t want to do anything else until it’s right. And Beverly Hills Cop, more than anything, resonated the world over as far as my characters go. People still call me Axel Foley when I go somewhere. The third Beverly Hills Cop was so bad that I’m like: “Look, let’s not do a fourth one until it’s perfect.” <strong><u>(5)</u></strong> When it’s right, or if it gets right, then I’ll do it. And it’s not just Beverly Hills Cop: I’m not doing any movies, any more, until the scripts are just right. Because you can get a big cheque for a shitty movie, but I did enough of those that I don’t ever have to do it again [laughs].</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <p>1) Eddie was talking to us at 6am his time in LA.</p> <p>2) Murphy played seven characters in 1996 comedy The Nutty Professor, famed dinner-table fart scene and all.</p> <p>3) Whoever posts Murphy’s tweets writes them in first person from time to time.

Shostakovich’s 4th with Britten’s Frank Bridge Variations, and a <a href=\"http://www.lucernefestival.ch/en/festivals/festival_in_summer_2015/events/berlin_philharmonic_rattle_kashimoto_grosz/\">“Symphonie Imaginaire”</a> created by Rattle himself from Haydn’s instrumental works, will apparently make the case for Haydn the radical rather than the taken-for-granted classicist. Too right. And those lucky enough to be in Lucerne for the concert will also apparently hear the “Viennese Classical master’s MP3 player … in the form of a flute clock that reproduces Haydn’s music through a small mechanical organ with a pinned cylinder”. That could be Swiss humour or it might bear some relationship to reality – but I have absolutely no idea what it might mean. Rattle, no doubt, will reveal all.</p> <p>Oh, and before I leave Rattle, is there a potential clue for a concert that might be coming the way of a certain rotundoid behemoth in the environs of Albertopolis in the late summer, in the shape of Rattle’s performance of <a href=\"http://www.lucernefestival.ch/en/festivals/festival_in_summer_2015/events/vienna_philharmonic_bbc_proms_youth_choir_rattle/\">Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius</a> with the Vienna Philharmonic and the BBC Proms Youth Choir, which Lucerne will host on 13 September? It may not take a concert-planning genius to work that one out – but on the other hand, I could be sorely mistaken. In any case, the prospect of Rattle teaching the Vienna Phil Elgar as he taught the Berliners Sibelius is an enticing one. This could be a performance that restores Elgar to his Austro-German musical roots, putting him squarely in the tradition that Richard Strauss knew he was indebted to when he called him “the first English progressive musician” in the wake of performances of Gerontius in Germany in 1901 and 1902; the piece had its Viennese premiere in 1905.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d28dbc9fec68835b8fc5cc8dce5ca629546df2c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/19/1424367907973/d8b82668-d8bc-4e5f-9d9e-c4e0be85cceb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"French composer and conductor Pierre Boulez in 2011\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French composer and conductor Pierre Boulez will be honoured with a day of performances.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most significant of all in Lucerne’s programme, I think, is the celebration of Pierre Boulez’s 90th birthday year.

Boulez founded the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLv0XsjhHdY\">Lucerne Festival Academy</a> in 2003 for young musicians from all over the world to specialise in the performance practice of 20th- and 21st-century works, and after 12 seasons, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dmOJhC7Ycc\">academy</a> has created a living tradition of impassioned engagement with this most vital of repertoires. Boulez’s health prevents him from leading the Academy this year, which will be run instead by the conductor <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfvT0xheCsA\">Pablo Heras-Casado</a> and the composer-conductor <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BU8KLb64-4\">Matthias Pintscher</a>. Throughout <a href=\"http://www.lucernefestival.ch/en/festivals/festival_in_summer_2015/events/ensembles_lucerne_festival_academy_leroy_1/\">A Day for Pierre Boulez</a>, you’ll be able to hear eight world premieres from composers including György Kurtág, Wolfgang Rihm, and Heinz Holliger, and there’s a grande selection of Boulez’s own works, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfnf15xVb8c\">Messagesquisse</a> for seven cellos to the atomised eight-part ensemble of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k7EXNZqIUg\">Rituel in Memoriam Bruno Maderna</a>. Lucerne is where Boulez has arguably contributed the most to the future of new music in recent years, in his coaching and commissioning of composers, his tutelage of conductors, and above all his performances of the music he knows and loves the best with groups of astonishingly talented young musicians (like the revelatory concert of his own<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/03/exquisite-labyrinth-review\"> Pli Selon Pli</a> that he conducted at the Royal Festival Hall in London in 2011). It’s fitting that his legacy is celebrated so fully there. Even if it can only amount to a fractional tribute to the most important, transformative, and provocative composer-conductor of our times, A Day for Pierre Boulez should be one of the essential classical musical experiences of the summer.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-02-20T13:50:52.333Z","standfirst":"<p>The programme for this summer’s classical music festival in

Thus I don’t know if those records feature as many torturous lyrical cliches as this one (whisky, Jesus, Johnny Cash and beers with the old man all feature, and that’s just the track titles), or are sung with such constipated insincerity.

Guetta claims Rihanna's 'soundtrack' album is going ahead","body":"<p>Rihanna is making a soundtrack album. In addition to a much-anticipated eighth studio LP, the pop star has collaborated with David Guetta on what’s thought to be a new Dreamworks cartoon.</p> <p>Guetta, who has <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAc4zHEDd7o \">produced two</a> of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FHdo7kxhW8\">Rihanna’s previous</a> top 40 singles, revealed to The <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/goss/411632/Rihanna-two-new-albums\">Daily Star</a> that he had recently “done a couple of tracks” for the singer. But the work was neither for Guetta’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/29/emeli-sande-nicki-minaj-ladysmith-black-mambazo-david-guetta-listen-album\">new album</a> nor Rihanna’s follow-up to Unapologetic. “She’s doing a film and the music is for the soundtrack to that film,” he said. “It’s quite different.”</p> <p>Although most outlets have greeted this news with confusion, there is actually a likely explanation. Nine months ago, Dreamworks Animation boss Jeffrey Katzenberg <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/rihanna-to-make-concept-album-for-dreamworks-animations-home-1201120819/\">told Variety</a> that Rihanna had agreed to “create a concept album” for their upcoming movie, Home. The 26-year-old was already set to lend her voice to the picture alongside Steve Martin and Jennifer Lopez; she would also allegedly write, record and perform new songs.</p> <p>At the time, Home was due to be released on 26 November. Directed by Antz helmer Tim Johnson and based on Adam Rex’s children’s book The True Meaning of Smekday, Home has now been pushed back to March 2015. According to Dreamworks, it tells the story of the “resourceful” Tip, reportedly played by Rihanna, as she tries to save humanity from an alien species called the Boov. <br /></p> <p>It has taken an uncharacteristically long time for Rihanna’s latest album to see the light of day. Apart from 2008, the Barbadian singer released a new full-length every year from 2005 and 2012. The new one is out “very soon”, Rihanna told ET in <a href=\"http://www.etonline.com/music/154114_rihanna_new_album_coming_very_soon_et_interview/\">mid-November</a>. “I’m really excited about the music that we’ve been working on, so I can’t wait for people to hear it.” She has reportedly been working with producers and songwriters including Kiesza, DJ Mustard and Stargate.</p> <p>2012’s Unapologetic debuted at No 1 in the UK, spawning two top five singles: Stay and Diamonds. </p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-24T09:15:42.000Z","standfirst":"<p>Rumours of the

about 99p track prices, but getting fans to donate rather than delete and re-download might be the best move","headline":"Band Aid 30: why donations not downloads may be the best strategy","body":"<p>Band Aid 30’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? topped the UK singles chart with 312,000 sales in its first week, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/24/bob-geldof-do-they-know-its-christmas-charity-delete-and-download?CMP=twt_gu\">Bob Geldof is worried about how much money that will bring in</a> to help the charity appeal.</p> <p>Why? Because those 312,000 sales were downloads on the iTunes and Google Play stores, selling for 99p each rather than the £3.50 charged for the original Band Aid single in 1984.</p> <p>“We need to sell 300% more than we did than [in 1984] to even begin to make up the cash figure. That worries me,” <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/30169534\">Geldof told BBC Radio 1</a>, before encouraging fans to delete and “download again” if they’d bought the new single.</p> <p>That won’t do much good, for modern music download stores let people re-download their previous purchases for free. But Geldof’s comments do raise a wider question: in 2014, is a song still an effective way to raise money for a charitable cause?</p> <p>Actually, the answer is probably still yes, but not necessarily by selling it.</p> <p>Watch the Band Aid 30 video on YouTube, and you might notice the “Download on iTunes NOW” link that remains on-screen throughout:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1jeiC-JEsI\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1jeiC-JEsI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, an “i” icon at the top left of the screen pops up a little carousel directing viewers to iTunes and Google Play to buy, or to the <a href=\"https://mydonatetelethonsappeals.bt.com/donate/bandaid30/\">official Band Aid donations website</a>.</p> <p>The description for the video has iTunes and Google Play first, then the link to the donations site, and a reminder that people can also text AID to the shortcode 70060 to donate £5.</p> <p>It’s surprising that the latter isn’t more to the fore in the campaign, especially given the way the standard price for a single has dropped from £3.50 or greater to 99p in the digital age.</p> <p>312,000 sales of the Band Aid 30 single would be equalled by just over 61,000 people sending a text message, and YouTube is an ideal platform to grab maximum online attention for this kind of campaign, then nudge them to donate.</p> <p>A song – particularly one with a video full of stars – is still a great vehicle for this, and the inclusion in this year’s supergroup of YouTubers Zoella, Alfie Deyes and Joe Sugg shows that the Band Aid organisation aren’t strangers to the idea of <a href=\"http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/5.12/es_attention.html\">“the attention economy”</a>.</p> <p>Standalone videos posted on YouTube by those three alone with a call to donate could be a powerful way to drive Band Aid 30 donations beyond past campaigns’ records, and that’s without suggesting similar videos (or even just tweets) from participating artists like One Direction, Ed Sheeran and Olly Murs.</p> <p>Other possible solutions to the headache of 99p downloads: make an EP with outtakes and spoken-word tracks with artists talking about what the Band Aid 30 campaign means to them, and sell it for £3.50; bring streaming services like Spotify on board from the start rather than <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a609083/sir-bob-geldof-on-band-aid-30-single-dont-just-stream-it-on-youtube.html\">leaving them until the new year</a> as they may be able to drive donations rather than cannibalise sales; sit down with Twitter and Facebook to figure out how to use their features to drive donations; gather the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/22/youtube-games-channels-pewdiepie-stampy-ksi\">top Minecraft YouTubers</a> and some music stars for a Twitch live-stream with a strong call for donations; act on the tough realisation that for many people, virtual currency in mobile games has more value than music nowadays, and work with some top app developers.</p> <p>(Apple has just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/24/apple-ios-app-developers-aids-charity-red\">kicked off a campaign for AIDS charity Red</a> using that last strategy. A fortnight’s percentage of in-app purchases of virtual items in games like Clash of Clans, Puzzle &amp; Dragons and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood alone is going to yield a heap of most-definitely-not-virtual cash.)</p> <p>This isn’t to suggest that Band Aid 30 isn’t accepting direct donations or telling people how to make them (it is, on both counts) or that it’s so stuck behind the times of the modern music industry that it’s not taking advantage of new platforms (it is, sort of).</p> <p>It’s more that it’s not worth Bob Geldof wasting energy worrying about 99p downloads, when there are more positive ways of fundraising that Band Aid can and does use. The way people value recorded music may have changed since 1984, but their willingness to give more than a quid for an important cause when made aware of it is much less in doubt.</p> <p>And for all the criticism, Do They Know It’s Christmas? remains a powerful awareness raiser, whether it’s Band Aid 30 that your £5 is going to, or another charity tackling the Ebola crisis.</p> <p>• <a

Adding, “this is PERVERTED &amp; disgusting behaviour that should NEVER be tolerated, especially by people who do NOT want this.”</p> <p>So far no media outlet has published nude photos of Perry, although <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2846450/Katy-Perry-shows-INCREDIBLE-figure-pink-bikini-soaks-sunshine-Sydney-Harbour.html\">Daily Mail Australia</a> did post photos of the singer in her bikini as she relaxed with friends on board a yacht sailing Sydney harbour.

has achieved this milestone without physical sales or streaming.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Official Charts Company said: “Band Aid 20 sold 200,000 each week for its first four weeks on sale - can Band Aid 30 keep up its sales momentum and beat its predecessor? It’s possible - a physical version is set to be released in December, which means the track is still a serious contender for 2014’s official Christmas number one.”</p> <p>Band Aid 30’s feat means it is the fourth time a version of the song has reached number one.</p> <p>Geldof told BBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills: “I’m constantly amazed by this country.

It just seems that everyone just says ‘yeah, heads down, we’re going to do this’ and, believe me, we are going to do it.”</p> <p>Olly Murs is also a new entry at number three with Wrapped Up featuring Travie McCoy while Ed Sheeran’s former number one Thinking Out Loud falls two places to number four.</p> <p>One Direction entered the album chart at number one with Four, racking up 142,000 sales, outselling its nearest rival by more than 90,000 copies.

The Radio 4 programme is, at times, in danger of making her sound like a veteran clothes designer rather than a woman with her eyes fixed on Britain’s top political job – especially when May selects a lifetime subscription to <em>Vogue</em> magazine as her one permitted luxury item.</p> <p>“I enjoy clothes,” the home secretary confesses, adding that she wants an Abba track to have “something to jump up and down to”. “My husband and I are sort of the Abba generation,” the 58-year-old politician explains.</p> <p>“So, home secretary, did you agree to appear as a castaway to show a warmer, personal side?” asks the presenter, Kirsty Young, before many discs have been spun. After all, Young continues, the leading Conservative has been criticised by parliamentary colleagues in the past for not being sufficiently clubbable.</p> <p>No, May insists, this is not the reason for the interview. “This is genuinely a huge opportunity to do a programme that has become an integral part of British life. Not everybody gets invited on <em>Desert Island Discs</em>.” And when it comes to clubbability and hanging around in Westminster bars, she is forthright: “It is not me.”</p> <p>The first of her chosen eight discs is the Four Seasons’ hit Walk Like a Man, and yet, although May loves the song, she argues it is important to her that she is allowed to do her job as herself. In politics, she says: “People should not feel they ought to walk like a man.”</p> <p>Young repeatedly questions May about her supposed ambition to lead her party, but she will not be drawn: “David Cameron is a first-class leader and a first-class prime minister. I hope he will be doing it for a very long time.”</p> <p>Her own political philosophy revolves around the idea that “individual people can make better decisions than government”. She says: “I don’t think I have got a ruthless streak. And I don’t have an ‘ism’ other than Conservatism.”</p> <p>Her Home Office role, May confirms to Young, is tough and so she would like one desert island track to “enliven my mood on occasion”. A recording from the 1980s BBC sitcom <em>Yes, Minister</em> fits the bill; she is given an extract from the episode The Compassionate Society, written by Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, in which a government minister learns that a new hospital in north London is treating only one patient.</p> <p>Philip May, her banker husband of 34 years, is “her rock”, the home secretary says. He helped her cope when her mother and then her father, who had been an Anglican cleric, died in quick succession in 1981. May and her husband met, she confirms, when they were Oxford students attending a Conservative Association disco. A fellow undergraduate, the late Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto, made the introduction. Was there a romantic <em>coup de foudre</em>? “I quite liked him,” reveals May.</p> <p>The hardest part of her current job is being forced to look at the worst side of humanity, and further shocking revelations about historical child abuse lie ahead, May strongly suggests: “We have only just begun to even start to recognise the enormity of this question.”</p> <p>In a highly controlled performance, the politician admits to just one recent mistake: parliament should perhaps have been given a vote on European arrest warrants. “If we were starting again we should look at that,” she says.</p> <p>Asked by Young about her diagnosis last year as a type 1 diabetic, May is characteristically matter-of-fact. “I just get on and deal with it. I inject insulin four times a day. You just have to get into a regime,” she says.</p> <p>As a book to read during her desert island stay, the home secretary picks Jane Austen’s <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-23T00:06:12.000Z","standfirst":"But home secretary stonewalls when asked on Radio 4 show whether she wants to be prime

There may be other, bigger-grossing tours, but for fans disaffected with routine concerts, nothing can rival the sense of expectation and event that Lollapalooza has aroused.</p> <p> The tour was the brainchild of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/16/janes-addiction-great-escape-review\">Jane’s Addiction’s</a> lead singer Perry Farrell, its drummer, Stephen Perkins, and Marc Geiger and Don Muller from Triad Artists, the group’s booking agency. The idea was conceived after Jane’s Addiction attended Britain’s Reading Festival last year. The band was booked to play at the festival, an annual three-day event featuring top alternative bands, but pulled out because of illness. Instead, band members attended as spectators and, impressed by the atmosphere, soon began to wonder why there was nothing similar in the United States. Mr Geiger and Mr Muller, who had previously organised alternative rock tours of the United States, decided that a mobile festival was feasible, if logistically daunting.</p> <p> From the start, Mr Farrell wanted Lollapalooza to be not just a musical event but a cultural smorgasbord, with a diverse array of tents, booths and displays exploring a number of political, environmental, human rights and cultural issues. The idea, says Mr Muller, is to bombard festivalgoers with stimuli and data and “raise as much public awareness in a single day as possible.” At each show, there is an “art tent”, displaying work by local artists personally selected by Mr Farrell.</p> <p> In this respect, Lollapalooza seems to be a conscious attempt to re-invoke the 60s sense of rock as counterculture, in defiance of today’s perception of rock as a leisure industry. “It’s throwing a lot of issues into the public consciousness,” Mr Farrell says. “I want there to be a sense of confrontation. But I’m not declaring myself left-wing or right-wing, I’m actually bringing both sides into it.”</p> <p> While planning the festival, he toyed with having National Rifle Association and armed forces stalls next to representatives from Greenpeace or animal rights organisations, to stimulate debate. “It would be way too easy for me to take everything that’s obviously politically correct and have this hip, left-wing event. But I don’t want to make out I have the answers, all I want to do is pose the questions.” The NRA and the armed forces recruiters, however, proved to be gun-shy about the event; participants instead range from the League of Women Voters to Handgun Control Inc. to Body Manipulations, which will display body piercing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJvFUXhpAeU\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJvFUXhpAeU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p> The lineup of bands for Lollapalooza is just as varied. Each band represents a different faction of alternative rock: Siouxsie and the Banshees (goth, a mystical, morbid descendant of punk, whose fans look like Morticia from The Addams Family), Living Colour (black rock), Nine Inch Nails (electro-industrial), Ice-T (gangster rap), the Surfers (acid rock) and the Rollins Band (hardcore punk).</p> <p> Jane’s Addiction’s music is itself a product of the fragmentation and cultural overload that Mr Farrell wants Lollapalooza to mirror. Like Faith No More and Fishbone, Jane’s Addiction belongs to the new hybrid genre that has been dubbed “funk-and-roll”, but the group takes musical miscegenation further than any of its peers. Jane’s Addiction emerged from the same late 80s Los Angeles metal scene that spawned Guns N’ Roses. But by its second and third albums, Nothing’s Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual (Warner Brothers), it became clear that “metal” was an inadequate tag for Jane’s Addiction’s exhilarating fusion of heavy rock, funk, reggae, ethnic influences, tribal rhythms and art rock. Three Days, an epic, 10-minute track off Ritual, covers the distance between the astral metal of Led Zeppelin and the ethereal, ambient drift of the Cocteau Twins. Some regard Jane’s Addiction’s departure from the straight and narrow of populist rock as self-indulgent, others as heroically pretentious. But for all its art-rock complexity, the band seldom sacrifices the raw attack of pure rock-and-roll.</p> <p> At live shows, Jane’s Addiction unites disparate subcultures as successfully as it melds musical influences. Its audience is a bizarre coalition of metal fans, punks, college-radio hipsters, goths, nouveau hippies and the unaligned and curious. What attracts such a motley array of fans is that the band has managed to bring back a sense of rock-and-roll as an underground. There’s a strong element of ritual and ceremony to Jane’s Addiction performances, heightened by the group’s stage backdrops: for the Lollapalooza tour, a shrine-like construction is covered with icons, candles and sculptures. “Most of the stuff that we use at the moment is taken out of my apartment,” says Mr Farrell, who is something of a jack-of-all-trades (his sculptures appear on the covers of both Nothing’s Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual).</p> <p> Jane’s Addiction also has an aura of danger and the forbidden. Mr Farrell’s lyrics and lifestyle are steeped in Romanticism’s creed of impulse, instinct, living on the edge and systematic derangement of the senses. His rock-and-roll forebears are Patti Smith, Iggy Pop of the Stooges and, above all, Jim Morrison. Mr Farrell, who is 32, has revived many of Morrison’s favourite riffs: the idea of “reinvention of the self” (as a glamorous deviant), the notion of the rock singer as shaman, the Dionysian quest for oblivion through excess. Jane’s Addiction is a heady confusion of <em>fin-de-siecle</em> decadence and back-to-nature primitivism. Is there a contradiction there?</p> <p> “The only way I can see that excess is against nature is that maybe when you get intoxicated, you can get sick,” Mr Farrell says. “But both decadence and the back-to-nature impulse are about freedom. You feel free when you hit the great outdoors, and you feel free when you get intoxicated.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQfjfqZo3Jk\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQfjfqZo3Jk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p> Mr Farrell is also interested in magic and syncretic Latin American forms of Catholicism that incorporate pagan rituals. The back of the Ritual de lo Habitual album depicts a medicine shelf packed with potions (plus a canister of Methadone, an allusion to the group’s highly publicized drug problems). On a recent trip to Mexico, Mr Farrell married his girlfriend in a blood-mingling ceremony presided over by what he describes as “a very serious witch”. Perhaps Mr Farrell is attracted to paganism because it is sensual and earthy, whereas monotheistic religions like Christianity, Islam and Judaism tend to restrict the ways of the flesh.</p> <p> “The problem that a lot of people have with me is that I’m having a good time,” says Mr Farrell. “It’s not even that they disapprove of what I do, it’s just that I’m doing it, and they’re not. That’s what I hate about those patriarchal religions: the guilt trip. I just don’t feel guilt.”</p> <p> Hence lyrics like “ain’t no wrong now, ain’t no right, only pleasure and pain” – in essence, Nietzsche’s Beyond Good and Evil rendered in rock-and-roll idiom. For Mr Farrell, the only sins are self-denial, the deferment of gratification and boredom. “The only time I feel guilty,” he says, “is when I know I’m doing something that’s really worthless, like watching TV, when I’m belittling myself by allowing my time to be consumed by nothing.”</p> <p> Mr Farrell’s creed is Romanticism’s age-old quest to “live now”. Or as Mr Farrell puts it on Jane Says: “I’m gonna kick tomorrow.” Like Jim Morrison, Jane’s Addiction’s message to its fans is not to “waste the dawn”, but to choose a life of insatiability and restlessness.</p> <p> “For a lot of the year, I’m usually in a different city every day,” says Mr Farrell. “I simply can’t fathom how people can bear to stay in one place. I’m bored very easily.” His fear of stasis and routine may have led to the decision to break up Jane’s Addiction after Lollapalooza and pursue other artistic ambitions. Mr Farrell has directed and appeared in a feature-length film, <em>Gift</em>, which has no release date. “I told Warner Brothers I’d give them five videos if they gave me $125,000 to make a movie. And I went to Mexico and made a film. So basically I got Warners to pay for my vacation. Mexico is wild. The people are hot-blooded, the weather is hot, the food is hot. The art is great too.”</p> <p>Mr Farrell’s decision to end Jane’s Addiction may confound the group’s fans. The band is on the verge not just of major commercial success, but of becoming a countercultural icon for a disenfranchised generation. The singer is adamant, however, that his future musical projects will not take place under the name Jane’s Addiction. The group is, however, going out in a blaze of glory. Lollapalooza is a boon for the twentysomething generation, a happening that may instil pride in teenagers who have grown up under the shadow of rock’s mythic past. As Classic Girl, the last track on Ritual de lo Habitual, puts it: “They may say, ‘Those were the days’… but in a way, you know for us these are the days... Yeah, for us these are the days.”</p> <p> © Simon Reynolds, 1991</p> <p>• Visit the site on Friday to watch a livestream of this weekend’s Lollapalooza</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-30T14:10:42.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Ahead of this year’s festival, we go back to August 1991 to see what Simon Reynolds made of the first event for this New York Times piece, lifted from Rock’s Backpages<br><br>• Visit the site on Friday to watch a livestream of this weekend’s Lollapalooza<br></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4vbkb","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/30/1406716417282/8df7713f-b2bf-4ffe-8284-b643cf781297-140x84.jpeg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"443340182","byline":"Simon Reynolds","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-14T13:30:00+01:00"},"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-e2cd0d0e-c653-478b-9df2-0df4b00dcb98","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/30/1406716420663/8df7713f-b2bf-4ffe-8284-b643cf781297-2060x1236.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/30/1406716420663/8df7713f-b2bf-4ffe-8284-b643cf781297-2060x1236.jpeg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Chris Hyde","altText":"Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction.","suppliersReference":"120102244","height":"1236","credit":"Photograph: Chris Hyde/Getty Images","caption":"Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction.

She’s sipping white wine, looking immaculate and expensive in a Grey Gardens-style headscarf and shades, so her antipathy to festivals barely needs to be pointed out. She seems to be in a playful mood, despite the surroundings of Worthy Farm. She’s funny and flirty – not real flirtation, but a kind of deliberate power play designed to upend the dynamic of an interview. When I ask what she thinks of the perception of her as coldly cerebral or arch, and whether being seen as clever could put off some potential fans, she raises an eyebrow and points to her chest. “But I’ve got big tits, right?” she quips. <em>“Right</em>? You’re not even looking at me!” I’m embarrassed, I shout. “Wonderful,” she roars, and claps her hands together.</p> <p>She’s flown in from Los Angeles, where she’s been having a lot of “meetings” especially for this show, and it’s clear that talking about herself bores her. “I don’t care about me,” she grins. “Just make it up. I don’t fucking care.”</p> <p>It’s been such an eventful six months that there isn’t much need to make it up. She’s gone from respected alt-rock curiosity to “the best rock band in the world”, according to the notoriously hard-to-impress Vice. Her fourth album, also called St Vincent, won her comparisons to Prince and made most other performers seem pallid and lazy by comparison. She appeared on Saturday Night Live, a high-profile TV gig that again seemed to perplex and astonish its viewers in equal measure. She’s toured the world with a tightly eccentric live show full of neurotic white funk and experimental party pop, wearing lurid Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? eyeshadow and sporting a shock of gunmetal-grey hair. Finally, for one evening in April, she became the frontperson of Nirvana, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AdVK5qKL-w\">singing Lithium with Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear</a> during their first public performance as Nirvana since Kurt Cobain died in 1994.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-da3ca49c-2c4c-4397-86da-bf28b7680068\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/7/1407424724926/338a015e-d1ed-4bdc-a027-b7860fc0d882-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"St Vincent at Nirvana's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Vincent and Kim Gordon perform with Kris Novoselic at Nirvana’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, 10 April 2014. Photograph: Theo Wargo/WireImage for Rock and Roll Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clark says that in spite of all this, only two things feel different about her life right now. Recently she went to a friend’s wedding in Austin, Texas, where people wanted to take drunk selfies with her, and a stranger bought her a cookie as she dined alone. “But I think the real gauge of things is when your mother’s friends don’t think you’re homeless,” she smiles.</p> <p>Clark has been on the alternative rock scene in the US for over a decade. In 2005, having dropped out of the prestigious music college Berklee, she joined the Polyphonic Spree. She played in Sufjan Stevens’s touring band in 2006, made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/06/david-byrne-st-vincent-review\">Love This Giant</a>, a joint album with David Byrne, in 2012, and has released four solo records to date, each increasing exponentially in their ambition and acclaim. But in 2014, something has shifted, and not just because her mother’s friends now know she has a job. “The whole <em>everything</em> feels more fully realised this time,” she says. “The loose ends are tied up, in a good way.”</p> <p>St Vincent is a strong contender for the best album of the year, but Clark’s performances, too, have metamorphosed into an impressive theatrical spectacle of their own. They incorporate jittering choreography and surreal spoken-word interludes, with Clark wearing defined, dramatic dresses that are more costume than fashion. “I find a lot of liberation from structure,” she explains. “If I know where I’m supposed to be, then I can deviate, and live in the moment. The process first became about execution, then about liberation. And I think it takes a lot these days to entice people to be in the moment.” She says that despite the rigidity and planning that goes into the show, she never worries that it will come across as contrived. “There’s always a gulf to be traversed between reality and perception. So if you have a situation where you’ve <em>beta-tested</em> the reality, then you can refine it. I watched videos of things and I went, ‘You know what, that doesn’t translate, that doesn’t do what I wanted it to do.’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOI0lH9v1Ig\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eOI0lH9v1Ig?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>St Vincent performing Digital Witness at Glastonbury 2014. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She sounds like she’s describing an art project or a performance piece, but the reality is far more fun than pretentious. “Once you’ve seen the show, it doesn’t come across as cerebral, I don’t think. Especially as we’ve done it more and more. It might come off as crazy, but it doesn’t come across as overly intellectual.”</p> <p>One of Clark’s favoured musical tricks is to make the normal suddenly unsettling, whether by bending notes to make it seem as if the floor is shifting, or throwing in a guitar solo that sounds like an anxiety attack, or uprooting the mundane with an unexpected lyrical twist. On the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUYz1J-WkV4\">Birth in Reverse</a> (its title taken from a Lorrie Moore short story, Which Is More Than I Can Say About Some People), she sings, “Oh what an ordinary day, take out the garbage, masturbate.” I tell her it made me laugh.</p> <p>“No,” she corrects, drily. “That was <em>deeply sexual</em>. That’s weird that you weren’t turned on, fuck.” Clark admits she’s a “comedy nerd” (her first album is called Marry Me, after a recurring gag in the sitcom Arrested Development, and she has twice appeared in the sketch show Portlandia) – and there’s often a black humour in her lyrics. “Not in a ‘put the honking nose on the clown’ kind of way. Not like, you know, slapstick. But I think the Nick Cave song, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jc0ib5Rh5s\">There She Goes My Beautiful World</a>, which I took the name St Vincent from, that’s a hilarious song. It illustrates the squalor, and the grandeur.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b8bfbe9c-8e85-44b8-848c-34fb2ff6c4d0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/7/1407423890238/fa6b3ae8-d510-42d7-9ca9-5b8e281f0bde-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"St Vincent with David Byrne\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Vincent’s Annie Clark with David Byrne, with whom she recorded the 2012 album Love This Giant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Clark joined Nirvana, she played with them twice – once at the glossy, televised Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony for HBO, and later that same night again, at the tiny, grimy St Vitus bar in Brooklyn. “I wish that Kurt was alive and no one else had to sing those songs,” she recites, respectfully, but acknowledges that Grohl and Novoselic’s decision to recruit female vocalists (Kim Gordon, Lorde and Joan Jett also stepped up) was fitting. “The thing that was cool to remember was that they came up in that Olympia scene in the late 80s and early 90s, which was really feminist and queer and punk, which kind of gets whitewashed in their history. This was a really nice way to honour that.”</p> <p>Clark, 31, was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma but grew up in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas. She remembers the first time she heard Nevermind, playing it over and over on a stereo as she learned skateboard tricks in her friend Doug’s garage: “It really did feel like Nirvana was a band for outsiders, that just happened to reach millions and millions of people.” As a teenager, that appealed to her, and in the past she has referred to herself as a “Texas freak”. “I always felt like a weirdo, and I was,” she says now. She takes huge pauses while she explains how she feels about her home state. “It’s a hotbed of … very conservative values. So even if you stick out by a thread, you’re going to be perceived very much as a freak … So you have to own it … I made a place with music where I could exist and not feel weird and alien.”</p> <p>She says Texas has “an ambient religiosity, and no matter what’s going on in your household, you internalise that culture of fear. And either accept it, or rebel against it.” Clark and her sisters were raised “half-Catholic and then half-whatever” by her mother and stepfather. Though her songs are often shot through with religious imagery, which she admits she loves (in taking her band name, she in effect canonised herself), she says she is “done with that Catholic guilt”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsUKQWCzGEc\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NsUKQWCzGEc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>St Vincent performing Bring Me Your Loves on Late Show with David Letterman.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“My last day in a church was the day I got confirmed. But yeah, I think it affects you, even if it’s not fire and brimstone in your house.” I ask her if she’s ever tempted to go to back to confession. She shakes her head. “No. I write songs, so I don’t have to.” She changes tack. “It’s pretty sexy,” she announces. What is, confession? “Absolutely! It’s a sexy construct.” How is it sexy? “Really?” she says, incredulous that I’m even asking. “I mean, I’m not saying Father Mac was particularly sexy. It’s a sexy construct, though. It’s a bizarre intimacy.”</p> <p>The phrase applies equally well to her music. On the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idllxjHbX7w\">Prince Johnny</a>, one of the best on St Vincent, she sings a fascinatingly ambiguous tale of gender and friendship and affection against a setting of decadence and parties, with a plea to someone to make its characters “a real girl” or “a real boy”. On the surface, it sounds like eavesdropping on conversation, yet in the end it’s so enigmatic that it’s impossible to interpret. This is, you suspect, exactly how Annie Clark likes it.</p> <p>During her performances, Clark ends Prince Johnny by rolling down a geometric pink podium in slow motion, resembling a crumbling starlet taking her last breath, as the music slows to an abstract blur, and she ends up on her head. On television, even more so than on stage, this looks like something from another world. On Saturday Night Live, she performed Birth in Reverse with a gleefully choreographed wooden-doll shuffle. She’s well aware that these antics are divisive. “A lot of people were very confused,” she says, happily. “I appreciate that it was a little bit polarising. There were certainly a number of people who were like: ‘Yay, that was cool, I’ve never heard of you, I’m going to buy the record.’ Then there was a whole other wide swath of the American public that was just scratching their head. I think that’s great. You might be doing something wrong if you’re beloved by everyone.” She looks completely satisfied.</p> <p><em><br /></em></p> <p><em>St Vincent tours the UK from 19 August, including <a href=\"http://www.endoftheroadfestival.com/\">End of the Road festival</a> (29-31 August). <a href=\"http://ilovestvincent.com/\">ilovestvincent.com</a></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-08-20T22:01:28.000+01:00","standfirst":"<p>Annie Clark is about to bring her eccentric live show back to the UK, but not before she tells all about the influence of Nirvana, religion and conservative values on her ‘Texas freak’ teen years</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4vhzm","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2014/8/7/1407423689894/St-Vincent-and-Glass-Anim-004.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"444015487","byline":"Rebecca Nicholson","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-10T18:00:02Z"},"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-982841ed-0c95-4421-b9c1-a12ee1135fa9","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2014/8/7/1407423696354/St-Vincent-and-Glass-Anim-010.jpg","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2014/8/7/1407423696354/St-Vincent-and-Glass-Anim-010.jpg","source":"London News Pictures/REX","photographer":"London News Pictures/REX","altText":"St Vincent at London Shepherd's Bush Empire, 20 February 2014","height":"372","credit":"Photograph: London News Pictures/REX/London News Pictures/REX","caption":"St Vincent at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire, 20 February 2014: 'it takes a lot these days to entice people to be in the moment'.

Flanking the bed are two white horses. Previously horses have had been best known in music for their metaphorical role – the Wild Horses that couldn’t drag Mick Jagger away – or as slang term for heroin, for decades the drug of choice for people who admire the makers of Wild Horses too much. By placing the horses so centrally, so early in the video, Taylor sends out a stark and unignorable message about equine rights. And, almost certainly, makes reference to the death of Emily Davison, the suffragette trampled to death by the king’s horse at the 1913 Derby. This is groundbreaking stuff. Later on, there’s a deer in the house. To be honest, that’s probably just the result of leaving the doors open.</p> <p><strong>Paradigm-smashing rating:</strong> 8</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02ec27adc3bf2563e9fe686a67d9c7acd2591472\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415632009939/e7d6321e-d62f-4061-9fe1-0a5f81538734-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Taylor Swift Horses\" width=\"420\" height=\"252\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yea or neigh … Changing the role of horses</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2 Taylor rides a bicycle indoors</h2> <p>The average arena or stadium tour creates more CO2 in three gigs than the entire Chinese coal industry does in a decade. That’s scientific fact [subs: please check]. By riding a bicycle indoors, after 38 seconds, Taylor sends out a stark and unignorable message about the need to move away the internal combustion engine, and possibly start using pedal power to generate electricity for homes, even mansions (especially mansions) if humanity is to survive. But what’s even more clever is that this comes just seconds after she’s featured a vintage sports car, driven by the man who’s clearly feckless and no good. By showing that car, Taylor sends out a stark and unignorable message that car usage and fecklessness are linked. And that cycling is a feminist issue.</p> <p><strong>Paradigm-smashing rating:</strong> 7</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ORhEE9VVg\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-ORhEE9VVg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>3 Taylor has a picnic consisting entirely of champagne and sweets</h2> <p>Whereas every other video featuring anyone ever will only show its stars eating macrobiotic Nicaraguan tofu, creating a climate of body fascism, Taylor chooses to be pictured eating sweets and drinking alcohol. In so doing, she sends out a stark and unignorable message that we and we alone control our bodies, and that we and we alone are the only people our body shapes need to please. This is made even more stark and unignorable by the fact that the video stars two slim and attractive people. Slim and attractive on the outside, perhaps, but isn’t the real message that they might be ugly on the inside. Think about it, yeah?</p> <p><strong>Paradigm-smashing rating:</strong> 5</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b0a96a8bc7ec181380367bae4c7ceb37421b5a6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415632410845/50caa8e8-b87e-4da2-808f-4b34131532cf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift picnic\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No pork pies … No Scotch eggs, either.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4 The bloke keeps using his phone</h2> <p>He does it while he’s having a picnic with Taylor. He does it when he’s in the garden with her. Taylor doesn’t look happy about it. That’s obviously because she’s sending a stark and unignorable message to Spotify that streaming is killing songwriters’ careers and she will have no part of it. The fact that it is a man fiddling with the phone is clearly a statement that the music industry is controlled by men, and only when a revolutionary coalition spanning sexes, genders, races and ages unites can we possibly develop a new music industry that nurtures creativity without exploiting listeners: that revolution is symbolised by Taylor dropping the phone into water. In many ways, that phone-drop is the most revolutionary moment in music since the invention of recorded sound. Its echoes will reverberate from here to the last syllable of recorded time.</p> <p><strong>Paradigm-smashing rating:</strong> 10</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1095d79634d139e3da05bd877175c36808b62b53\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415632286738/2f2a5645-7f52-474b-9f98-6b76c9056cec-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift phone\" width=\"420\" height=\"252\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Revenge … Take that, Spotify!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5 Taylor cuts the nipples out of the bloke’s shirt</h2> <p>In a very real sense, Taylor is sending a stark and unignorable message that she will not stand for the objectification of women in pop music a minute longer. So, record company executive, you think women are no more than a pair of breasts? Well, see how you like it when you are reduced to being nothing more than a pair of breasts. Alternatively, she is sending a stark and unignorable message that the boyfriend in this video is so stupid he puts on the shirt even though it is clearly missing both nipples. Which itself is almost certainly a metaphor for cuts to public services in an age of austerity: for what is healthcare in both the US and the UK but a nippleless shirt?</p> <p><strong>Paradigm-smashing rating</strong>: 8</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2189528fd80d52db8a9d60a0c37f8104045dd882\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415632088294/da5c1e6f-3b16-4277-be20-1de891bcc770-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Taylor Swift nipples\" width=\"390\" height=\"234\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take that, oppression!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6 Taylor hits the sports car with a golf club</h2> <p>This works on so many levels and sends out so many stark and unignorable messages, that this single scene should be considered a work of art in its own right, as well as one of the most profound statements of our age. First, Taylor is both literally and metaphorically destroying the automotive industry. That refers back to her evident desire to develop cycle-powered energy referred to earlier. It also sends out a stark and unignorable message that Taylor is destroying American colonialism, for what is a car but a symbol of American power? She is literally taking a club to the system that created her, an act of revolution that will have profound and far-reaching consequences. But there’s also a sly and brilliant wit here, in the choice of a golf club – for clubs such as the Royal &amp; Ancient and Augusta, the bastions of golf, have been dilatory in admitting women to their ranks. Golf, then, becomes a symbol for the entire entertainment-industrial complex in a message that is both stark and, dare I say it, unignorable.</p> <p><strong>Paradigm-smashing rating: </strong>10</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2490df7b3f2307694c34d8401e60b364bf4ef81\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415632171272/3d0143c6-43fd-40e6-9e73-18b8938ccea2-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Taylor Swift golf clubs\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fore! … An early bid for a Ryder Cup slot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab</span> </figcaption> </figure>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-10T19:36:03.340Z","standfirst":"<p>Last week, Taylor Swift redefined the entertainment industry by withdrawing from Spotify.

Here’s <strong>Pete Cashmore</strong>’s therapeutic playlist …","headline":"Putting the rap into therapy: can listening to hip-hop beat depression?","body":"<p>In the past, rap music has been criticised for its obsession with the high life, with the wearing of the most expensive clothes, the driving of the fanciest of cars and the watching of the most absurdly oversized home-entertainment systems. But what if we were to tell you that such flights of fancy can actually have a positive, socially beneficial effect? That is the theory being put forward this week by Cambridge University’s Department of Psychology, who offer the viewpoint that upwardly mobile rap can actually benefit those experiencing mental health issues.</p> <p>The study, which was published in The Lancet this week, is the brainchild of consultant psychiatrist Dr Akeem Sule and clinical neuroscientist Dr Becky Inkster. It posits the theory that a great deal of rap music, with its rags-to-riches narrative trajectories, displays “positive visual imagery”, a psychotherapeutic technique common among sports stars, in which one envisages the place where one would like to be, so as to facilitate one’s progression to a better mental place. Their chief example is Notorious BIG’s Juicy, in which he talks candidly about the deprived life he has known, and the new life with its chauffeur-driven limousines and 50-inch TV screens that is tantalisingly within his grasp. Far from being a celebration of flash and financial excess, Sule and Inkster believe that this is therapy and catharsis in action, “a means of breaking free [and] a message of hope …”</p> <p>The pair talk of being overwhelmed by the response from people who want to know more about the project, which featured at the University’s recent Festival Of Ideas, and hope to see it being applied in prisons, schools, hostels and other places where depression and low self-esteem are a constant concern.</p> <p>The therapeutic effects of rap and its use as a positive tool for education and personal development are well documented, as indeed they are for most forms of artistic expression and their beneficial effect on those who experience depression – I myself started battle rapping at the age of 38 and the pure catharsis I found through my performances was overwhelming and life-changing. But Sule and Inkster are offering a slightly different angle, that, in a nutshell, imagining a heavily blinged-out version of yourself taking your pet panther for a walk is an important step towards actually becoming that person (panther optional).</p> <p>That you might never get there is not the point – for someone experiencing the sometimes brutal mental pummelling of depression, to even see yourself as “winning” is a victory in itself. So what other tracks might help?</p> <p><strong>Jay Z – On To The Next One </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM1RChZk1EU\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WM1RChZk1EU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Sample lyric:</strong> <em>“World can’t hold me, too much ambition / Always knew it’d be like this when I was in the kitchen</em> <em>/ Niggas in the same spot, me I’m dodging raindrops / meaning I’m on vacay, chillin’ on a big yacht</em>.<em>”</em></p> <p>An urgent, insistent hymn to positive mental imagery, in which Jay Z relentlessly strives for bigger and better things despite being a squillionaire already.</p> <p><strong>Eminem – Lose Yourself </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmXumtgwtak\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bmXumtgwtak?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Sample lyric:</strong> <em>“Mom, I love you, but this trailer’s got to go / I cannot grow old in Salem’s lot / So here I go, it’s my shot</em> <em>/ feet fail me not / this may be the only opportunity that I got.”</em></p> <p>The finest elucidation of the rush of performance, coupled with the notion that rap is The Only Way Out.

And it’s just the tip of a booming industry turning out songs of bloodshed and devotion. <strong>Alex Marshall</strong> investigates the rise of the jihadi ‘nasheed’","headline":"How Isis got its anthem","body":"<p>The first two minutes and 52 seconds of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikBpsQQ6lzs\" title=\"\">Dawlat al-Islam Qamat</a> are undeniably beautiful. It is little more than an Arabic chant, sung by a man whose voice is so relaxed you expect him to drift off halfway through. It sounds timeless – as if it has been dug up from the eighth century. The man’s melody has got a gentle swing, something you could easily imagine a jazz drummer playing behind to give it some oomph. Soon he starts layering his voice, so it sounds like a whole choir is trading lines, the song’s impact growing as he does. Musically, it’s better than just about any other religious song you could name.</p> <p>But just as you are starting to enjoy it – perhaps thinking you might tell your yoga teacher to play it in class – some sound effects drop in. There’s a sword being unsheathed, the stomp-stomp-stomp of soldiers’ feet and some stuttering gunfire. And it is about that point you remember exactly what you are listening to. This is, to give it its English name, My Ummah, Dawn Has Appeared. It is the most popular song in the Islamic State. It is, arguably, the world’s newest national anthem. “The Islamic State has arisen by the blood of the righteous,” it goes. “The Islamic State has arisen by the jihad of the pious.” God Save the Queen it isn’t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" >  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ikBpsQQ6lzs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>“The Islamic State isn’t going to jump up and down and say, ‘This is our official song,’” says Phillip Smyth, a researcher of Middle Eastern affairs at the University of Maryland and a jihadi music obsessive. “But it’s recognised by the fighters and supporters as kind of their anthem. It just spells out everything they stand for: the Islamic State has arisen, we’ve defeated so many enemies, we’re going to keep on doing so. And it also sounds good. Even for an infidel like me, it has a certain quality. It invigorates certain spirits.”</p> <p>Behnam Said works for the Hamburg branch of German intelligence, analysing jihadi trends in the country, and is about to complete a PhD about jihadi songs, known as <em>nasheeds</em>. “The first time I heard it, I couldn’t get it out of my head for two weeks,” he says. “It touched me in a different way to other nasheeds. I’d sit on the metro and it’d come into my head.”</p> <p>The Islamic State’s “high-tech media jihad” – its use of YouTube, Twitter and Instagram to boost support – has received reams of press coverage over the past year. But its use of music seems to have slipped by. That might be because its songs are in Arabic and so harder for non-speakers to take in. It might also be because they all sound similar: a cappella chants sung by men and drenched in echo, all with spoken word intros in which someone says the Arabic word for “Introducing …” like a judge on The X Factor.</p> <p>But these songs are vital to the organisation. They provide the soundtrack to all the Islamic State’s videos; they are played from cars in towns they control, rather like US gangs use rap songs to demarcate their territory; they are even played on the battlefield. The group also seems to churn them out on an endless array of topics. Earlier this year, it put out an eight-minute nasheed called <a href=\"https://ia802304.us.archive.org/5/items/maghoor_201408/maghoor.mp3\" title=\"\">Al-Maliki, Your End Will Be Tomorrow</a>, directed at the former Iraqi prime minister, which seemed to be little more than an exercise in trolling. More recently, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/IM690udkYXM?t=2m16s\" title=\"\">it has been issuing songs</a> about the “life of security and peace” the Islamic State is providing, as if to convince people in the territory it controls it is worth supporting. If you need more evidence of the importance of these songs, some rival jihadi groups have reportedly banned them from areas they control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a6d781ad26cbc7c7c9f98dd971cc0dd739aaf19\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/7/1415383062824/03ad06a7-7117-4fea-8a85-5fd2eb30d4c0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A still from a nasheed-soundtracked video\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from a nasheed-soundtracked video.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jihadi nasheeds date back to the late 1970s, when Islamic fundamentalists in Egypt and Syria started writing them to inspire their supporters and get out their message. “Nasheeds as a genre of religious songs are old,” Behnam says, “but supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and other groups started making ones that were political and rebellious in the 70s. That was new.” These were circulated on cassette, reaching a wide audience.</p> <p>Some stringent fundamentalists, mainly Salafists with their literal interpretation of Islam, condemned nasheeds, saying music was unIslamic and a distraction from studying the Qu’ran. But this didn’t stop them. Even a teenage <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/osamabinladen\" title=\"\">Osama bin Laden</a> founded and sang in a nasheed<em> </em>group in an effort to avoid being seen as “too much of a prig”, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/09/shopping.politics1\" title=\"\">The Looming Towers</a>, journalist Lawrence Wright’s history of al-Qaida.</p> <p>Most Islamic scholars now say nasheeds are acceptable, especially during wartime. In fact, the only major disagreement over them seems to be what they should sound like. Most Sunni jihadi groups, including the Islamic State, see instruments as <em>haram</em> (forbidden) and take a bare-bones approach to their composition. Almost all their nasheeds are a cappella, the only accompaniment being an array of sound effects from horses’ hooves (symbolising the Prophet Muhammad’s time in the desert) to bombs.</p> <p>But Shia groups such as Hezbollah do not care for such self-restraint. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox7nPTbhUCc&amp;channel=UCRcQ7aPHx7hOC2fqICpuKdg\" title=\"\">Many of their nasheeds are packed with drums</a>, sometimes seeming to place as much importance on rhythm as rap or ragga. Their singers also apparently cannot get through a verse without <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv5BzovaaHo&amp;channel=UCOC4QzsaQM7njw06rCOAGPg\" title=\"\">heavily processing their voices with Auto-Tune</a>, and they’re so packed with young men dancing they seem more boyband than militia. Shia groups also have a seemingly endless supply of nasheeds set to dramatic string arrangements, which could have been plucked straight from some Hollywood thriller.</p> <p>“These groups will call their songs nasheeds, but sometimes they don’t even fit in with their own ideologies,” says Smyth. “If Ayatollah Khomeini was still around, he’d probably look at some of the techno stuff and go, ‘What the hell is this?’ But the groups are all operating off some kind of religious guideline. They’re getting an ayatollah who’s saying, ‘Yes, this is halal. Go for it.’”</p> <p>The Islamic State’s songs may be a step back musically from those being produced by Shia jihadis, but the organisation is changing the landscape of nasheeds in other ways. “Most jihadi groups tend to recycle nasheeds that have been around for years, but the Islamic State has its own wing, the Ajnad Media Foundation, that’s dedicated to producing them,” says Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Forum, who has become a controversial figure since being <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/tamimi-2014-7\" title=\"\">accused of becoming too close to the jihadis he studies</a>. “It’s using them to say it’s new and distinct, as well as to get across its message.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox7nPTbhUCc\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox7nPTbhUCc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Behnam agrees, pointing out that the Islamic State’s nasheeds often contain a different message to other groups. “Older nasheeds tend to have been produced by groups that are small, militant and clandestine, and they have a more defensive message – but there were many saying, ‘They can torture us, but we are holding to our beliefs.’ The Islamic State’s nasheeds are not defensive at all. They are about a hope to change the world for ever.”</p> <p>No one seems to know who exactly is writing the Islamic State’s songs. The consensus appears to be that the words are written by poets, the melodies by musicians, while a separate person sings. “In Iraq, there are lots of different production companies,” Phillip Smyth says, “and the same in other countries. In Lebanon, I once wanted to see how it was done and sat in a room that was in a guy’s mother’s basement. He had a little keyboard, a little recording thing, and he put together this entire song for a Christian militia in a week and a half.”</p> <p>The influx of westerners into Islamic State ranks – which includes a German former-rapper called Deso Dogg who has tried his hand at nasheeds with appalling results – is unlikely to lead to a demand for more modern songs, says al-Tamimi. “The jihadis with their mindset don’t see their songs as dull. They feel repulsed by the Shia’s willingness to use instrumentation and things like this.”</p> <p>My Ummah, Dawn has Appeared was released online in December 2013, and its ongoing popularity shows its staying power. If the Islamic State does continue, could it be named an official anthem? One thing seems to stand in the way: anthems are a western concept.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-10T11:00:19.864Z","standfirst":"<p>A stark Arabic chant is emerging as the anthem of the Islamic State.

The music is taut and punchy and urgent: the vocals swirl with reverb, James Dean Bradfield's serrated, Skids-influenced guitar toughs it out for space with icy draughts of electronics. It sounds triumphant, but the lyrics tell a rather different story. They're racked with self-doubt and disappointment, a litany of failure and \"broken plans\".</p><p>Moreover, it doesn't take a huge leap&nbsp;of imagination to think that the lyrics seem to be about the Manic Street Preachers themselves. \"We'll come back one day, we never really went away,\" runs the chorus of Futurology, which sounds like a typically perceptive assessment of the issues facing a band of such longevity. For nearly a quarter of a century, the Manic Street Preachers have been a fixture of British rock. Given how combustible they initially seemed, they've proved remarkably consistent in their latter years: even their least successful album, 2004's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/nov/05/popandrock.shopping9\" title=\"\">Lifeblood</a>, went silver and came cluttered with intriguing ideas. But consistency tends to get you taken for granted: it's as if audiences want dramatic peaks and troughs, a narrative of disasters and comebacks, to keep their attention. That's even more true of the media, although in the Manics' case, their interest has been held by bassist Nicky Wire's legendary inability to keep his opinions to himself. Had they been blessed with a bass player capable of shutting his trap once in a while, they might well have faded from view, into a half-life of solid reviews, ageing diehard fans and back-catalogue tours, regardless of the quality of their music.</p><p>Nothing if not self-aware, you suspect this is a fact of which this band are perfectly cognisant. Too smart to waste everyone's time going through the motions, their recent output has been marked by the sense of a band torn between winding down and carrying on. Wire described 2010's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/16/manic-street-preachers-postcards-young\" title=\"\">Postcards from a Young Man</a> as \"one last shot at mass communication\". From its title down, last year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/12/manic-street-preachers-rewind-review\" title=\"\">Rewind the Film</a> had an elegiac quality to it, replete with songs about the melancholy nostalgia of middle age.</p><p>It makes Futurology all the more startling. It was apparently recorded in&nbsp;tandem with Rewind the Film at Berlin's legendary Hansa studio, but it couldn't be more different. For all the beauty of its melodies, its predecessor felt reflective and resigned. By contrast, Futurology feels invigorated and exhilarating. All the self-laceration in its lyrics – behind the sparkling pop melody of The Next Jet to Moscow lurks a portrait of Wire as \"an old jaded commie … the biggest living hypocrite you'll ever see\"; Walk Me to the Bridge's acknowledgement that \"old songs leave long shadows\"; the protagonist of Between the Clock and the Bed mired in \"hatred and failure growing perfectly together\" – seems to have spurred them into decisive action.</p><p>As their biographer Simon Price once noted, Wire has a tendency to talk up new Manics albums in outlandish terms, wildly citing musical precedents that no one but he can hear in the finished product: heavy metal Tamla Motown, Goldfrapp meets late-70s Bowie. This time, however, they have succeeded in threading a set of fresh influences through their trademark sound. You hear it most dramatically on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJNcs5gKZwg\" title=\"\">Europa Geht Durch Mich</a>'s ferocious electronic glam stomp – Add N to&nbsp;(X)ish synthesisers squealing over a bovver-booted rhythm section, Bradfield trading verses with the stentorian voice of German actor Nina Hoss – and in the instrumental Dreaming a City (Hugheskova). The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/26/manic-street-preachers-futurology-glastonbury-eurostars\" title=\"\">obvious comparison for the latter is Simple Minds' Theme for Great Cities</a>, although its melody bears a John Barry-like quality: in a typical Manics twist, the great city of their title was a Russian industrial powerhouse, founded by a Welshman and initially populated by workers shipped in from Merthyr Tydfil.  Elsewhere, the tense, metronomic pulse of Neu! underpins The Next Jet to Leave Moscow and Misguided Missile, and the kind of sampled orchestral stabs that studded the early output of the ZTT label and Thomas Dolby's forgotten 1984 masterpiece <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNIQrIXlrNw\" title=\"\">The Flat Earth</a> burst around military drum rolls on Divine Youth. The appearance of Scritti Politti's Green Gartside on Between the Clock and the Bed, meanwhile, is a masterstroke: there's something really thrilling about hearing the honeyed sweetness of his voice clash with the rawness of Bradfield's vocals.</p><p>Of course, plenty of bands have adopted influences from 80s post-punk pop and krautrock in recent years, but they've seldom weaved them into their own sound this deftly. Futurology never feels like a pastiche, and sounds unmistakably like the Manic Street Preachers while sounding unlike any other album they've made. From the glorious chorus of Walk Me to the Bridge to Black Square's lovely shifts in&nbsp;tempo, the songwriting is almost unerringly great. Indeed, it stretches the boundaries of their sound so skilfully that that the track that bears most resemblance to the Richey Edwards-era Manic Street Preachers – Sex, Power, Love and Money, a distant, shouty cousin of Generation Terrorists' <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nDAHV7hPFs\" title=\"\">Repeat (Stars and Stripes)</a> – sounds a bit clunky by comparison.</p><p>There's something rather telling about that. The best most artists can hope to achieve this far into their career, with their commercial peak 20&nbsp;years behind them, is to make an&nbsp;album that cravenly evokes their \"classic\" sound, in the hope of jogging a few memories, and provoking reviews that blithely talk about a return to form. Futurology, on the other hand, doesn't recall the Manic Street Preachers' debut album, but it could pass for a&nbsp;debut album – and that's an infinitely more surprising and appealing state of affairs. \"We've done the best we can,\" offers the title track, dolefully. As it turns out, that's more than good enough.</p><p>• This review has been corrected; it originally stated Futurology was the band's 11th album.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-07-03T16:55:17Z","standfirst":"The Manics' exhilarating, krautrock-tinged 11th album is unmistakably theirs, but unlike anything they've done before","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3qj7v","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/2/1404312457155/Manic-Street-Preachers-fr-006.jpg","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"441097335","starRating":"4","byline":"Alexis Petridis","shouldHideAdverts":"false","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-02T14:44:00Z"},"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-441211047","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/2/1404312465648/Manic-Street-Preachers-fr-012.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"David Levene","displayCredit":"true","source":"Guardian","photographer":"David Levene","altText":"Manic Street Preachers, from left: Nicky Wire, James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore.","height":"372","credit":"David Levene/Guardian","caption":"Invigorated and exhilarating… Manic Street Preachers, from left: Nicky Wire, James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore.

Or so he told the one journalist he spoke to on the record at the time, Michael Iachetta of the New York Daily News.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1fc5de89-7d30-4564-98f2-04a123fe13a6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/30/1414693280663/38728c23-4d90-4bc2-bc92-22cbc8cb6c64-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dylan and the Band\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Dylan and the Band hanging out in Woodstock at the time of the Basement Tape sessions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  Elliott Landy, Landyvision, In</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But according to Al Aronowitz, the one writer he spoke to regularly, off the record, throughout 1967: “That was just a contribution to the Dylan mystery. Actually, Dylan was writing 10 new songs a week, rehearsing them in his living room with [Robbie] Robertson’s group, the Hawks [AKA <a href=\"http://theband.hiof.no\" title=\"\">the Band</a>].” And it turned out Aronowitz was right – the aural evidence began dribbling out in late 1967 as other groups started releasing their recordings of the songs Dylan had been writing, beginning with Peter, Paul and Mary’s version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3W1-Pco9Uk\" title=\"\">Too Much of Nothing</a> that November</p> <p>Why had Dylan and his friends been working so hard? To what purpose? According to Robertson, the reason “we would play music every day” was “to keep one of us from going crazy”. He may not have meant Dylan, who was slowly wending his way back from the brink, but rather the Band’s Richard Manuel, who was heading unsteadily towards the cliff. (He would finally take his own life in 1986.)</p> <p>What began as a form of musical therapy, initially in Dylan’s own Red Room at his home in nearby Byrdcliffe, soon evolved into so much more. In late spring 1967, when proceedings transferred to the Hawks’ colourful home, dubbed “Big Pink”, organist Garth Hudson set up a simple soundscape: three mikes into an Altech mixer, with instruments panned left or right, on to a Nagra reel-to-reel – what Robertson later called “this shitty little recorder” – that had already seen service on their dramatic 1966 world tour with Dylan. And the tapes kept a-rollin’.</p> <p>For when it comes to “the basements”, evolution is the key. The Basement Tapes were, and are, a musical process; a journey away from the edge via the rich traditions of Anglo-American song. Such is the attention to detail and sheer intensity in Dylan’s delivery on songs such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrEh8IqnRl4\" title=\"\">Young But Daily Growing</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40ieOMoTXQ\" title=\"\">The Banks of the Royal Canal</a>, both steeped in a tradition that was to him “the only true valid death you can feel today”, that they often seem like the meat of the matter.</p> <p>But by the middle of 1967 the secret sessions had a more immediate purpose: they had become a way for Dylan to show the Band how to make their own statement in song. The razor-sharp Robertson realised what was going on quickly enough: “Bob was educating us a little. The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us … but he remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He’d come over to Big Pink … and pull out some old song – he’d prepped for this.” Yet it was Manuel and Rick Danko whom Dylan was trying to teach to release their demons in song, not Robertson, who had yet to pen a single song he could call his own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lD-64YsRg0\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lD-64YsRg0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Dylan even gave Manuel and Danko a lyric apiece to put to song. And what lyrics – <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blz_sef-jj4\" title=\"\">Tears of Rage</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkbkkbicmYs\" title=\"\">This Wheel’s on Fire</a>. By then, he had started using the sessions as a way for him to fulfil the demand for new songs his manager and co-publisher Albert Grossman was making, albeit at arm’s length. (Dylan had spent much of his recuperation poring over the 10-year management contract he signed in 1962, and he was not amused.)</p> <p>Starting in June or July 1967, Dylan began laying down songs with enough pop sensibility, a surfeit of madcap lyricism and even a chorus or 12, to be copyrighted and distributed to any artist keen to record one or more unreleased Bob Dylan songs. These songs, with titles such as Yea Heavy And a Bottle of Bread, Tiny Montgomery and Crash on the Levee (Down in the Flood) seemed to have been mined direct from some ancient realm of poesy, so rich was the wordplay and many-humoured the worldview. It was like “Phaedra with her looking glass” had made a secret tryst with “Einstein disguised as Robin Hood”, and this was their progeny.</p> <p>Whether characters such as Quinn the Eskimo, Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank were laughing at or with their listeners Dylan refused to resolve, but it mattered not. What came across most was a joie de vivre that suggested he couldn’t believe he was still alive, literally, let alone creatively. And if the five musicians seem at times as if they are teetering on the brink of insanity (The Spanish Song, Next Time on the Highway, All You Have To Do Is Dream can all now take a bow), it is because they were.</p> <p>Indeed, this joyous musical brinkmanship seems most evident on those occasions when the musicians sound wholly pie-eyed. Because anyone who thinks Dylan had cleaned up his act after his fall simply ain’t been listenin’. These guys are flying low over the mountains, pilled to the gills, low as Hamlet, high as kites. Take one listen to Teenage Prayer, which puts the I in innuendo. Or Please Mrs Henry, as scatalogical as a Carry On film. Or Sign on the Cross, in which the keys to the kingdom come wrapped in silver foil. These songs have Mystery written all over them, but beware of licking the label lest a white rabbit appear.</p> <p>By January 1968, when the first 14 songs were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/29/bob-dylans-basement-tapes-review-1967-rocks-backpages\" title=\"\">collected on to publishing demo acetates</a>, just about anyone with a stake in the future of rock wanted to hear – and indeed own – copies of Dylan’s own versions. As such, for the next seven years, the 14 (later, 18) songs Dylan copyrighted would circulate first on reel-to-reel and then, from 1969, on the bootleg albums this hallowed set of acetates spawned.</p> <p>At the same time, these seminal songs enjoyed a parallel life as chart fodder for the likes of Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqU5qDly71o\" title=\"\">This Wheel’s on Fire</a> – a UK No 1), Manfred Mann (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qoyWU_EDDU\" title=\"\">The Mighty Quinn</a> – a Top 5 single), the Band (I Shall Be Released and Tears of Rage), the Byrds (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAekNYSKigU\" title=\"\">Nothing Was Delivered</a>) and Fairport Convention (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAWDj31AKIQ\" title=\"\">Million Dollar Bash</a>). McGuinness Flint went as far as recording seven basement tracks for their 1972 all-Dylan album, <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/Coulson-Dean-McGuinness-Flint-Lo-Behold/master/427155\" title=\"\">Lo and Behold</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-11e23c58-c4ab-4279-90e9-61424804ab0b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/30/1414688160922/b61abf9a-d0fe-40d6-9d52-3ba3c5749719-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dylan in the pink, parked up near Woodstock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elliott Landy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In those years The Basement Tapes grew in the public imagination to constitute a body of songs as famous as the reclusive folk-rock bard himself. Soon enough, no charity gig was complete without a rousingly righteous I Shall Be Released, while The Mighty Quinn became the basis for any number of football chants. The real music from Big Pink – almost despite Dylan – was everywhere.</p> <p>Yet the circumstances of these remarkable recordings remained steadfastly vague, despite Rolling Stone’s Jann Wenner pressing Dylan during his second major post-accident interview to spill the beans, asking him for “the origin of that collection of songs, of that tape”. When Dylan pretended not to know what he meant, Wenner asked flat-out: “Where was that done?” Dylan, attempting to dismiss the subject with an offhand, “Out in somebody’s basement – just a basement tape,” unwittingly christened the tape for all eternity.</p> <p>The subject seemed to continue bothering Dylan even as he finally approved an official release, largely to help fund the Band’s relocation to California. He hardly proved forthcoming when asked about the tapes by Mary Travers, the former singer in Peter, Paul and Mary, on her own radio show.</p> <p>Travers had been among the first to hear the Big Pink fare, Peter, Paul and Mary’s recording of Too Much of Nothing predating even that song’s copyright registration. And Travers was simply trying to do Dylan a favour by previewing the imminent release of the official CBS Basement Tapes set, a set Dylan told Travers was being released “so people could hear it in its entirety and know just exactly what we were doing up there in those years”.</p> <p>The release, now, of a further 122 songs as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/30/bob-dylan-the-band-basement-tapes-complete-review\" title=\"\">The Basement Tapes Complete (Bootleg Series Vol 11)</a> rather suggests Dylan was blowing smoke signals the day he sold his message to Mary. He must have known that Band guitarist Robbie Robertson and producer Rob Fraboni had compiled an extensive set of “reference” tapes from the 17 or so reels. Even with recourse to just three of the dozens of cover versions they had recorded, it comprised 45 Dylan performances and 10 Band performances (mostly studio takes), from which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Basement_Tapes_songs_%281975%29\" title=\"\">that 1975 set</a> was ultimately compiled.</p> <p>Back in 1975, no one knew the 16 Dylan songs on said CBS set were the tip of an enormous iceberg. However, even then, just about every critic worth his truckload of salt knew that the set was missing at least half a dozen important Dylan originals. Hence the tears of outrage that greeted the omission of I Shall Be Released, Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn), the hymnal Sign on the Cross (one of the most exquisite Dylan vocals in his entire lexicon) and the elliptical I’m Not There, while the “correct” demos of Too Much of Nothing and Tears of Rage were sacrificed for first runthroughs. (All of the above were already circulating in collector circles.)</p> <p>And there was more: specifically five more Basement originals copyrighted in 1973, the lyrics of which suggested even more tantalising treasure lay outside collectors’ reach. None of these songs – Silent Weekend, Santa Fe, Bourbon Street, All American Boy and Wild Wolf – would circulate until the early 90s, by which time the whole of Wild Wolf and two-thirds of the completely mad Bourbon Street had disappeared from the upstate locker of Band archivist Garth Hudson.</p> <p>It turns out that all these tracks, with the exception of All American Boy, were part of a 50-minute composite reel that had been loaned by Hudson to Dylan’s office in the early 1990s, and never seemingly returned. And because they were not in Hudson’s lockup, they were not accessible to the Band roadie who helped himself to direct dubs of most of the other reels at the time Dylan’s first Bootleg Series was appearing, in 1991.</p> <p>Relocated by Sony archivist Glenn Korman, that reel appears on the new Basement Tapes edition in its entirety, revealing not only all five 1973 copyrights but four more gems only previously whispered of in Dylan circles: My Woman, She’s a-Leavin; Mary Lou, I Love You Too; Dress It Up; Better Have It All; and What’s It Gonna Be When It Comes Up.</p> <p>What makes the contents of this reel particularly intriguing is the suspicion, confirmed by the reel number assigned by Hudson back then, that this is probably the last Basement reel, save for a three-song Anthology of American Folk Music jam session. Indeed, we appear to have crept into 1968 with these recordings. John Wesley Harding has certainly been recorded already, and we are witnessing how the Hawks plan to reintegrate Levon Helm – who had missed the Basement sessions – into their new sound while continuing to experiment with an inspired Dylan, even after he returned from three trips to Nashville with his new album and, seemingly, a new direction home.</p> <p>This, it seems, was the direction Dylan was heading in when those inspirational “lights went out”, as he put it in 1978. Wild Wolf may well be the last time he went “half-stepping” before his muse pulled the switch. Five long years of creative darkness would follow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-99a48d2d-705b-4b5e-994f-3c85cd29ebe6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/30/1414688520697/078ef06a-2f16-4539-9dc2-ca2496c0ae4e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan on the porch\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Dylan on the porch at his home in Woodstock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elliott Landy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That final reel thus provides one of the bookends on the new 6-CD Basement Tapes Complete. For fans of Dylan’s unique brand of Anglo-Americana, the set also reveals the sessions’ starting point – an equally vital, if ropier-sounding two sides’ worth of Red Room recordings that predate anything collectors have heard to date on the many bootleg Basement recordings.</p> <p>For once, such a “for completists only” trawl through the vaults serves to fill in the blanks and connect the dots in such a way that one’s appreciation of Dylan and the Band’s achievement is actually heightened. These backwoods boys rehearsed off tape and rarely recorded more than two takes of anything, originals included. Listening to all their extensive forays, one finally understands what Robertson meant when he suggested that they were trying to “stop time”.</p> <p>And for those who think this is a case of “feel the width”, somewhere in among the haunted leaves of this mighty tree is a 24-track collection of all the songs copyrighted between 1967 and 1975, which would rank alongside any Dylan collection. Sadly, Sony wasted an opportunity to release such a companion CD. Instead, they went with a 2-CD version that is neither fish nor fowl, as much mish as mash.</p> <p>Nevertheless, this banquet really needs to be savoured entire. After all, seeing the stack of reels that sat in a Toronto studio awaiting transfer to digital, one can’t help but be reminded the boys at Big Pink took their time. The Basement Tapes, which for years were seen as the work of a few summer days, turn out to be nine months in the life of a former boy wonder and a family man, at a time when he could still make music in the most idyllic of settings and count his blessings.</p> <p>Even Dylan allowed himself to wax lyrical about those times when prompted to remember them by a young Wenner: “You know, that’s really the way to do a recording – in a peaceful, relaxed setting, in somebody’s basement, with the windows open and a dog lying on the floor.” No expectations, no commitments. Just for the love of it. Expect to spend a lifetime unravelling the mystery that is Big Pink. Dylan has.</p>","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-03T10:57:42.000Z","standfirst":"The Basement Tapes have never before been heard in their entirety.
